# Dual Degree Project
This bioinformatics project on multi-omics/multi-tissue data integration and imputation started from the graph convolutional networks and view correlation discovery network used in the [MORONET](https://github.com/txWang/MORONET/) study. "MORONET is a multi-omics data integrative analysis framework for classification tasks in biomedical applications."  

Since then the project has seen many improvements. A more detailed report stating the project's objectives and achievements will be presented here soon.
